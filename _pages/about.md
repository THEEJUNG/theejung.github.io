<i>Note: I am looking for full-time or internship position on statistical data analysis after my graduation (expected May 2017).</i>

Currently, I’m a graduate student in the <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at University of California, Berkeley. I’ve finished my first semester at Berkeley and took fundamental courses such as Probability, Statistics and Statistical Computing. For next semester (Spring’17), I will be focusing on applied statistics and practical methodology, such as Linear Modeling and Machine Learning.

Prior to the graduate study, I worked as a data analyst at <a href="http://www.koreacb.com">Korea Credit Bureau</a> (KCB) for 6+ years. My main role was to develop predictive and statistical models, and consult clients in financial industry and governments. 

<!-- My interest is analyzing data to obtain meaningful knowledge and gaining benefit from the knowledge for making better society.--> I am interested in merging heterogenous data from multiple resources and adopting appropriate statistical methodology to find meaningful knowledge.
<!-- , and using it to find probability for practical services with developers or to give potential profit to the clients. -->
